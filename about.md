I am a software engineer at [Major League Baseball](http://www.mlb.com){:target="_blank"} in New York, NY. I graduated from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu) where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I was previously a full-stack engineer at [Comprehend](http://www.comprehend.com).

In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, watching any Chicago sports team, and rating and commenting UIUC bathrooms on [IlliniDumps](http://illinidumps.com).
