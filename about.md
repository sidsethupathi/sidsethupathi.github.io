I am a junior at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu) studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. In the past, I've worked at [Nexteer Automotive](http://www.nexteer.com), [JPMorgan Chase](http://www.jpmorgan.com), and will be interning this upcoming summer at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) on the [Office](http://office.microsoft.com) team.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, watching any Chicago sports team, rating and commenting on [IlliniDumps](http://illinidumps.com).

The summer before my freshman year in college, I hacked together a blog in PHP and MySQL in order to learn web development. I did learn a lot during that project, but in the end, it didn't make a whole lot of sense to keep that project up and running. Since then, I've also learned it isn't necessary to reinvent the wheel. I recently stumbled across [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Minimal Mistakes](http://mademistakes.com/articles/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme) and thought it looked cool enough to try out.
