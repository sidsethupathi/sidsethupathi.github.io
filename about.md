I am a full-stack engineer at [Comprehend](http://www.comprehend.com){:target="_blank"}. I graduated from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu) where I studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. In the past, I've worked on the Office team at [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) in Seattle, [JPMorgan Chase](http://www.jpmorgan.com) in Chicago, and [Nexteer Automotive](http://www.nexteer.com) in Saginaw, Michigan.

In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano and organ, watching any Chicago sports team, and rating and commenting UIUC bathrooms on [IlliniDumps](http://illinidumps.com).
